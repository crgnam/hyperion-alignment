# Hyperion Alignment
[Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_\(moon\)) is a moon of Saturn with a highly unpredictable rotation rate.  This means that its orientation in space at a given time cannot be accurately predicted.

This project represents a quick prototype of a tool to align a low resolution shape model with images of Hyperion.
